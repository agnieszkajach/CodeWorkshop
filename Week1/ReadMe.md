#Week 1

##Calculator
This weeks challenge is to build a desktop calculator. This will contain a subset of the features of the standard calculator that is installed with Windows.

The provided code consists of the UI for the calculator, your task is to write the code that will make the calculator work.

###Instructions
Write code that you are comfortable with. Make the code and design as clean as you can, but your primary goal is to get as many features as possible working in the time available.

Timebox this challenge to no longer than three hours. The goal is to benchmark what you can achieve in the time available. We will compare your code in this challenge with a similar timeboxed challenge at the end of the six weeks.

If you are new to C#, you may like to play around with the problem to familiarise yourself with C#, but when you are ready to start the challenge, start from the initial state of the form, and stick to the three hour limit.

The three hours does not have to be one sitting. You can break it up into smaller sessions, but keep track of the time.

###Requirements
The requirements are reasonably obvious. If you are in any doubt about desired behavior try it out on the Windows Calculator and try to emulate it's behavior.

You don't have to worry about behavior for very large numbers e.g. limiting the number of digits or displaying in Scientific notation. The calculator should work for basic arithmetic with relatively small numbers.

There are some edge cases to be aware of such as clicking the decimal place multiple times, clicking 0 as the first digit, and clicking equals multiple times after calculating an expression.
